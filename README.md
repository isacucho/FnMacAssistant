<h2>Notice</h2>
There is currently an issue when downloading where you could either get stuck on 100% installed, get a connection error, or a full storage error. We still haven't managed to completely fix this issue. To play, you will have to manually download and install the files. You can find a guide on how to do it

<h3>What is the difference between the various IPAs?</h3>

**Clean IPA** <br>
The clean IPA (Fortnite-XX.XX_Clean.ipa) is the decrypted IPA as-is, no modifications whatsoever. Useful when trying to debug, but it may cause some issues like black bars.
<br><br>
**Regular IPA** <br>
The regular IPA (Fortnite-XX.XX.ipa) contains the following tweaks:
- MacOS Fullscreen Patch
- Removed device restriction
- Allows editing files from the Files app
- Lowered minimum iOS version to iOS 10
<br>

**Tweak IPA**
<br>
The tweak IPA (Fortnite-XX.XX+Tweak.ipa) comes bundled with the FnMacTweak made by rt2746. In addition to the tweaks mentioned on the regular IPA, this one also contains:
- Toggle pointer locking with Left Option key (unlocked by default on game load)
- Unlocks 120 FPS option (requires 120Hz display for full effect)
- Unlocks graphic preset selection (Low, Medium, High, Epic; 120 FPS sets to Medium)
- Custom options menu (press P) for mouse sensitivity adjustments
- Mouse interaction with mobile UI<br>
You can download the standalone tweak or build it yourself on the project's [Github page](https://github.com/rt-someone/FnMacTweak).
